## Simplan Workflow

**Simplan is for fast engineering, not vibe coding.**

This framework is designed for developers managing production code with serious quality concerns. It optimizes context usage by delegating to focused sub-agents, enforces bisect-safe commits, and keeps plans local (`.simplan/` is gitignored—these are your personal working notes, not project documentation).

### Overview

```
BACKLOG → PLANNED → IN_PROGRESS → DONE
   ↑         ↑           ↑    ↓      ↑
 /add      /plan       /exec ↔ IDLE /review
```

**Statuses**:
- `BACKLOG` - Work identified, not yet planned
- `PLANNED` - Plan created, ready to execute
- `IN_PROGRESS` - Currently being worked on (only one at a time)
- `IDLE` - Started but paused (switched to another item)
- `DONE` - All phases completed

### Commands

#### `/item:add` - Add a new item to the backlog
**Goal**: Capture work that needs to be done.

Creates a new backlog item with a title, type (Feature/Fix), and description. Items start in `BACKLOG` status, waiting to be planned.

**When to use**: When you identify new work, bugs to fix, or features to build.

---

#### `/item:plan` - Plan an item before coding
**Goal**: Break work into atomic, committable phases.

Takes a backlog item and creates a detailed plan by:
- Exploring the codebase to understand architecture
- Asking clarifying questions interactively (1-12 questions, max 3 rounds)
- Splitting work into small, reviewable phases
- Writing the plan to `.simplan/plans/<number>-<slug>.md` (or a folder for extensive plans)

Updates item status from `BACKLOG` → `PLANNED`.

**When to use**: For straightforward items where requirements are mostly clear.

---

#### `/item:brainstorm` - Brainstorm extensively before planning
**Goal**: Deep-dive into complex items through extensive Q&A.

Like `/item:plan` but with much more thorough exploration:
- Asks 10-40 questions across multiple rounds
- Covers 10 categories: requirements, UX, technical approach, edge cases, integration, testing, scope, security, operations, and risks
- Creates comprehensive plans with full Q&A logs
- Documents which questions informed each phase

Updates item status from `BACKLOG` → `PLANNED`.

**When to use**: For complex features, architectural decisions, or items with unclear requirements. When you need to deeply understand before committing to an approach.

---

#### `/item:exec [item-number]` - Execute a phase
**Goal**: Implement one phase at a time with immediate review.

Executes a single phase from the plan:
1. Selects the item (auto-selects if no number given)
2. Moves any other `IN_PROGRESS` items to `IDLE`
3. Runs the `simplexecutor` agent to make code changes
4. Runs the `simpreviewer` agent to validate the changes
5. Shows changes for manual confirmation
6. Creates a commit with a descriptive message

**Item selection**:
- If item number provided: uses that item
- If no number: continues `IN_PROGRESS` item, or picks first `PLANNED`/`IDLE`

**Options**:
- `--model=opus|sonnet|haiku` to choose execution model

**When to use**: After planning, execute phases one by one. Review each before moving to the next.

---

#### `/item:review` - Review and complete an item
**Goal**: Ensure all work is complete and properly recorded.

Reviews a completed item to:
- Verify all phases were implemented
- Check commits exist for each phase
- Update any incomplete checkboxes in the plan
- Mark the item as `DONE`

**When to use**: After executing all phases, run review to finalize the item.

---

#### `/item:delete` - Remove an item from backlog
**Goal**: Clean up items that are no longer needed.

Removes an item and its plan file, renumbering remaining items.

**When to use**: When an item is cancelled, duplicated, or no longer relevant.

---

#### `/item:update` - Update simplan framework
**Goal**: Get the latest simplan commands and agents.

Downloads and installs the latest version of simplan. Detects whether you have a global or local installation and updates accordingly.

**What it updates**: Commands (`/item:*`) and agents (simplexecutor, simpreviewer).
**What it preserves**: Your project data (`.simplan/ITEMS.md`, `.simplan/plans/`).

**When to use**: Periodically, or when you want new features and bug fixes.

### Best Practices

1. **Plan before coding** - Always run `/item:plan` or `/item:brainstorm` before `/item:exec`
2. **Choose the right planning depth**:
   - `/item:plan` - For clear, straightforward items (quick: 1-12 questions)
   - `/item:brainstorm` - For complex or ambiguous items (thorough: 10-40 questions)
3. **Atomic phases** - Each phase should be a single, focused change
4. **Review each phase** - Don't rush through phases; review changes before committing
5. **Keep plans concise** - Focus on APIs and data structures, not full implementations
6. **One item at a time** - Complete an item before starting another

### File Structure

```
.simplan/
├── ITEMS.md                    # All backlog items with status
└── plans/
    ├── 1-add-auth.md           # Simple plan (single file)
    └── 2-refactor-api/         # Extensive plan (folder)
        ├── README.md           # Plan overview
        ├── phase-1.md          # Phase 1 details
        └── phase-2.md          # Phase 2 details
```

### Item Format

Each item in `ITEMS.md` includes:
- **Type**: Feature or Fix
- **Status**: BACKLOG, PLANNED, IDLE, IN_PROGRESS, or DONE
- **Description**: What needs to be done
- **Slug**: URL-friendly name (e.g., "add-user-authentication")
- **Plan**: Path to plan file/folder (set after planning)

>
> Or add a new item with `/item:add`
>
> Tip: Run `/clear` to reset context before starting work.
