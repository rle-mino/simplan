## Task

You are updating the simplan framework. Follow these steps in order:

### Step 1: Detect Installation Mode and Platform

Check for version files to determine installation type and platform:

**Claude Code:**
- `${XDG_CONFIG_HOME:-$HOME/.config}/simplan-source/.version` → Global installation
- `.claude/.simplan-version` → Local installation

**OpenCode:**
- `${XDG_CONFIG_HOME:-$HOME/.config}/simplan-source/.version` → Global installation
- `.opencode/.simplan-version` → Local installation

Read the version file to get current installed version.

If neither exists, inform the user that simplan is not installed and provide installation instructions:
```
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rle-mino/simplan/main/install.sh | bash
# OR for global install:
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rle-mino/simplan/main/install.sh | bash -s -- --global
```

### Step 2: Fetch Latest Version Info

Fetch from GitHub:
- VERSION file: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rle-mino/simplan/main/VERSION
- CHANGELOG.md: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rle-mino/simplan/main/CHANGELOG.md

Compare versions. If already up-to-date, inform user and skip to Step 4.

Otherwise, display the changelog to the user:

1. **Extract relevant entries**: Parse CHANGELOG.md and show all version entries between the current installed version and the latest version (inclusive of latest, exclusive of current)

2. **Format the changelog clearly**:
   ```
   ## What's New in v<latest>

   <For each version from latest down to current+1>

   ### v<version> - <date>

   <List all Added/Changed/Fixed items with brief explanations>
   ```

3. **Explain behavioral changes**: For each significant change, provide a brief explanation of what it means for the user. Examples:
   - "**`commit_plan` config option**: You can now optionally commit your `.simplan/` files alongside code changes. When enabled, simplan will ask before committing plan updates."
   - "**`item:exec` no longer auto-chains**: After completing a phase, you'll now be prompted to run `/item:exec` again instead of automatically continuing. This gives you more control over the workflow."

4. **Highlight new configuration options**: If new config options were added, note them separately:
   ```
   ## New Configuration Options

   The following new settings are available in `.simplan/config`:
   - `commit_plan` - Commit plan files with code changes (see Step 5)
   ```

### Step 3: Run Update

Ask user for confirmation before updating using AskUserQuestion.

Execute the appropriate install command:
- Global: `curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rle-mino/simplan/main/install.sh | bash -s -- --global`
- Local: `curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rle-mino/simplan/main/install.sh | bash`

Report the update result. The installer will automatically clean up deprecated files.

### Step 4: Check for .simplan/ Initialization

If no `.simplan/` folder exists in the current project:
- Ask user if they want to initialize it using AskUserQuestion
- If confirmed, create:
  - `.simplan/` directory
  - `.simplan/plans/` directory
  - `.simplan/ITEMS.md` with template:

```markdown
# Backlog

## In Progress

(none)

## Planned

(none)

## Backlog

(none)

## Done

(none)
```

### Step 5: Configure New Options

Check if `.simplan/config` exists. Parse it as key=value format (one per line).

For each configuration option that was introduced in versions between the user's previous version and the latest version, ask the user if they want to configure it.

**Available configuration options:**

#### `commit_plan` (added in v1.6.0)

Ask using AskUserQuestion:
- **Header**: "Commit plans?"
- **Question**: "Do you want simplan to commit `.simplan/` files alongside your code changes?"
- **Options**:
  1. **"Yes"** - Description: "Plan files will be committed with code. You'll be asked to confirm each commit. Requires removing `.simplan/` from `.gitignore`."
  2. **"No (default)"** - Description: "Plan files stay local and gitignored. Plans are personal working notes, not shared documentation."

If user selects "Yes":
1. Create or update `.simplan/config` with `commit_plan=true`
2. Check if `.gitignore` contains `.simplan/` - if so, inform the user:
   > **Note**: You'll need to remove `.simplan/` from your `.gitignore` to enable plan commits.
   > You can do this manually or I can do it for you.
   Ask with AskUserQuestion (Header: "Update .gitignore?", Options: "Yes, remove .simplan/" / "No, I'll do it manually")

If user selects "No" or skips:
- Do not modify `.simplan/config` for this option (default behavior is to not commit plans)

### Step 6: Report Summary

Provide a summary:
- Framework version: X.X.X → Y.Y.Y (or "already up-to-date")
- .simplan/ initialized (if created)
- Configuration changes (if any options were set)
- Any deprecated files that were cleaned up (reported by installer)

## Next Steps

Tell the user:

> Simplan updated to <version>!
>
> To load the new commands, restart {{PLATFORM_NAME}}:
> `{{EXIT_COMMAND}}` then reopen
